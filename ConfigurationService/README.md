# Configuration Service
This service should be used as a configuration service for the frontend. It will be written in Python<br>
and it will run in a docker-container.
## What to expect ?
- Change the hostname where the Backend runs.
- Change the port where the Backend runs.
- Return the current Hostname and port where the Backend runs.<br>
The Frontend can interact with the Configuration Service via REST.
